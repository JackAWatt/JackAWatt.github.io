The difference between a life and a career: 

Today, I realized just how much I've neglected the parts of my life that weren't technical. That studying and working on projects is a form of escape for me. I've realized that family, friends, and finding a partner should come before my career. 

I feel like taking time away from my work, to spend time with people I care about, will ultimately lead to doing better work, anyway. Taking breaks and having time to relax and engage with other people, can only lead to good things.
