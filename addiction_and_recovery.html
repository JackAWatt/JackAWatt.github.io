    I am a recovering drug addict and alcoholic(4+ years clean). I just want to say if you take your recovery seriously, things can and do get better. 
    <br><br>
    If you aren't an addict, but want to support the people around you who are in recovery, I really only have one suggestion: listen to them, don't feel like you need to solve all of their problems. 
    <br><br>
    These relationships are all about establishing trust and demonstrating empathy. 
    <br><br>
    People who are ashamed of their past--at least in my experience--tend to mostly trust other people in recovery, so make sure to point out how much you appreciate their trust if they are confiding in you. I know it's meant the world to me the few times I've opened up to people.
    <br><br>
    someone I've admired for a long time, has recently reached out to me -- after 5+ years of no contact. I'm only able to post all of this because I didn't feel like I had to hide who I am to her, and it's the push I needed to post this. 
    <br><br>
    Recently I shared a lot with her, but also added at the end that I hoped it wasn't too much to say, and she responded that she was honored I trusted her and to please not feel bad about sharing. 
    <br><br>
    She didn't try to solve my problem, she just made me feel heard and accepted. 
    <br><br>
    After talking to her, I feel accepted and appreciated. This one person's positive opinion of me, outweighs any amount of negative opinions from other people.  
    <br><br>
    The next person I open up to might not react the same way, and I have to be okay with that, and accept the risk.
    <br><br>
    Having a lot of shallow relationships is nothing in comparison to having a few real ones. Find the people you can be honest with, and--in my experience--you'll start feeling less ashamed of the parts of yourself you are working on changing. 
    <br><br>
    I'm just going to be the best version of myself that I can be, and will embrace the people who are accepting and want to be in my life.
    <br><br>
    Some people will tolerate you, others will love you. If you speak up and say who you really are, the people who really love you will be there.
    <br><br>
    I've almost made a post like this several times over the past year, but didn't have the confidence to appear vulnerable or to be seen as weak. 
    <br><br>
    The reality is that it is the shame that keeps us weak, not the problems we have or the problems of our past. 
    <br><br>
    I'm at the point now where I'm willing to be open about how I'm doing. Not everyone is, so make sure to check in on the people you care about, and tell them you care. You might think it's a small gesture, but in the case I laid out above, it meant a lot to me.
